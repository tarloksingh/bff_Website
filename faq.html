		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h2>What is bff?</h2>
		<p>Bff is an app to meet new people online instantly who want to be friends too.</p>
		<h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
		<p>Bff is free for your first month and then it is $7.99/month.</p>
		<h2>Who made bff?</h2>
		<p>Bff was designed and developed by Tarlok Singh and Jaween Ediriweera.</p>
		<h2>Why did you create bff?</h2>
		<p>When I was in New York, it was extremely difficult to make new friends quickly. In a place with 8.5 million people you would think that it would be easy but everyone seemed to already have a circle. I then started to wonder what if there was an app that was soley dedicated to making friends in a real way online.</p>
		<h2>When was bff launched?</h2>
		<p>Bff was launched in May 2023.</p>
		<h2>Is bff safe?</h2>
		<p>bff is designed to be a safe place to interact with new people. Users use their voice instead of text to communicate so it will be extremely difficult to fake who you are. We are working on achieving what it is like to meet people in the real world. Reporting a user is very easy on bff, just hold down a message and hit report and let us know what happened. Users who violate our safety.</p>
		<h2>Where is bff available?</h2>
		<p>bff is currently only available in certain cities. We are working on expanding out to more regions.</p>

		<h1>In App</h1>
		<h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
		<p>bff is available on the App Store here.</p>
	    <h2>How do I add friends?</h2>
        <p>From the main menu go to contacts. In contacts you can add anyone that is there by sending them a voice invite.</p>
        <h2>Who can see my profile?</h2>
        <p>Currently it is only possible for your in app friends to see your profile however anyone can see you in the discover section unless they are blocked.</p>
        <h2>Is there really no texting and only voice messaging?</h2>
        <p>Yes, we believe texting is a primitive form of communicating online when it comes to meeting new people. Sending a voice note is exactly how we talk when we meet new people in the real world. Voice notes also make it extremely difficult for users to lie about which gender they are and say grotesque things.</p>
        
        <h1>Account</h1>
